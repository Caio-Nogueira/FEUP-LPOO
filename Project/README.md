## Description
##### Jump, Shoot, Survive!

This project is based on the Linux Terminal game "Moon Buggy". In this game, you drive a vehicle across the moon's surface and try to avoid the dangerous craters by jumping over them. Along the way, there are also menacing aliens and robots that try to stop you, so you must shoot them down! The goal is to keep the buggy rolling as long as possible!

- **Crater Generation -** The surface contains craters that are randomly generated, the program also takes into account the minimum amount of floor required for the game to be possible.

- **Enemies -** During the game, aliens or robots are randomly generated, they each have their own stats and special attacks, so the player must shoot them down wisely.

- **Collision Detection -** The game detects when the buggy collides with the craters (with either its front or rear wheel) or gets hit by enemy attacks.

- **Game Animations -** There is a different set of animations for each of the buggies. These effects, along with some star animations, help simulate movement even though the buggy is always in the same horizontal position.
